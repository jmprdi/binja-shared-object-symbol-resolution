The plugin will open any shared object files if needed.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe plugin registers one command - \"Resolve Shared Library Import\". Right click on an external symbol (i.e. `004040d8  extern puts`), and select 'Resolve Shared Library Import'. This currently only works on ELF files.\n\n# Installation\n\nClone or symlink this repository into your plugin folder. (https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/plugins.html#using-plugins)\n\nEnsure that your system has `ldd` installed.\n",
